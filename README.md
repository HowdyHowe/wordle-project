# Wordle Clone

This project is a **simple Wordle game** that I built using **Next.js**, **SASS**, and **Redux**.  
The main purpose is just to learn how to combine these frameworks and libraries in a small project.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. The player must guess the secret word.
2. There are a maximum of 6 attempts.
3. After each guess, the letters will be colored as hints:
   - 🟩 Green → correct letter in the correct position
   - 🟨 Yellow → correct letter but in the wrong position
   - ⬜ Gray → letter is not in the word
4. If you guess the word correctly within 6 attempts → you win.
5. If you fail, the correct word will be revealed.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Next.js → React framework
- SASS → styling
- Redux → state management
